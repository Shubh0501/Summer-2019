## Welcome to my blog !!!

Before starting with my Summer 2019 experience and learnings, if you haven't visited my website, please [visit](https://shubh0501.github.io/) to know about me. 

This blog is divided into 8 parts each containing the details about that week's activity. If you have any problem with the content or any other issues, feel free to contact me. Let's get started.

### Week 1

My internship at Pudle! started from 26th May. I had already interacted with my Senior [Udit Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udit-bansal/) and another software intern [Vishwas Chhimpa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishwas-chhimpa-4751b8113/) before for some discussions. I realized that we were going to build a SPA(Single Page Application) using React and handle backend using Firebase. I had no experience in this field. I realized it soon that I have to learn a lot of things to make things work my way. From my first day, I started looking into the documentations of React and Video lectures in Youtube to learn about it as much as I could. In the first day, we were successful in implementing the authentication of user using Phone Number and Email(including verification) part using Firebase. We were supposed to be implementing Maps in our platform. I took the job to implement the map part while my colleague took the job for handling the furthur authentication part. First we decided to go along with Google Maps in our platform. For the next two days, I was working on the implementation of Google Maps. I saw a lot of libraries built or react which helps to implement Google Maps easily. At first, I decided to go along with [google-maps-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react). The library was well made and it solved some of my problems. Since I didn't had any experience in react and I was unable to find any good video lectures, I faced lot of problems to add markers dynamically in my platform. But after a lot of head scratching, I finally found the solution to add markers dynamically. I was working on the map implementation till thursday. On thursday, we were supposed to add search bar in our platform to let users search for a location. While implementing that, I saw in the Google Maps Platform, that they only allow a single request per day free for the Places API. After discussing with my senior and looking into the pricing structure of the Places API, we decided that we should go with [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) in our platform because of the high pricing structure of Google compared to MapBox. On friday, I started with implementing MapBox in our platform. For MapBox, I found an awesome [package](https://uber.github.io/react-map-gl/#/), developed and maintained by Uber. It solved a lot of problems of mine to implement the map in our paltform. For the searching in the map, I found another awesome [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mapbox-gl-geocoder), which integrates itself along with the Mapbox object and helps in searching in Maps easily. On Saturday, We documented our week's work and went for a small party. Also, we met our design intern, [Prerna Vimania](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prerna-vimania-a9baa2153/). We discussed along with our senior and interacted with each other. For the next week, we planned that we will be going along with the design sprint 2.0, to know more about our requirements. This marks the end of my first week at Pudle!

### Week 2

This week is all about the Design Sprint 2.0. It is supposed to be a 4 day activity but since we were all interns and not that experienced, we faced some problems in the later part of the sprint, which increased our time to 5 days. First day of the design sprint
